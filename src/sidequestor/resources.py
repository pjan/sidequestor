    `skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/` belong to the user; this writes
    into them so an interactive agent can discover the engine skills without being told
    a path. That makes the blast radius the important part of this function.

    THE CLAIM: Sidequestor owns the `yaas-` prefix inside these directories, and nothing
    else. Within that namespace it will DELETE a symlink it did not create — one whose
    name no longer ships, or whose target has moved. That is deliberate: a workspace that
    survives several upgrades would otherwise accumulate links to skills that no longer
    exist, and a stale link is worse than a missing one because an agent will follow it.
    The cost is real, so state it plainly: a hand-made `yaas-*` symlink here WILL be
    replaced. Name yours anything else and it is safe.

    Regular files and directories are never touched, at any name. If one occupies a name
    we want, we skip it and publish nothing there — the user's copy shadows ours, which
    is the right way round for a file they created on purpose.

    Links point through `.yaas/engine/current`, which sync_resources() repoints on
    upgrade, so an engine bump needs no re-linking: the existing symlinks follow it.
