    NOT counted as `parent.parent`: that is correct only while every script sits directly
    in yaas-triage/, and silently resolves to yaas-triage/ itself once a script moves into
    a subdirectory, producing a parallel state/ tree nothing reads. NOT keyed on CLAUDE.md
    (a fresh clone has only CLAUDE.example.md) and NOT on .git (two git dirs here, none in
    fixtures). Ambient $REPO_ROOT is deliberately ignored: a stale value pointing at another
    checkout would pass any marker check and silently redirect writes. Test fixtures copy
    the whole tree, so the walk-up finds the fixture on its own.

    Kept byte-identical across every file that needs it; tests/behaviour/repo-root.test.sh
    asserts that, because a shared module would need sys.path handling whose own path is
    depth-dependent, which is the bug being fixed.
