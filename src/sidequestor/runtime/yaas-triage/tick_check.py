tick_check.py — turn a checker's raw result into a per-watch VERDICT.

This is the analyze phase of the original shell orchestrator, and its single subtle decision: given what a checker
reported plus the watch's own history (is it in backoff? has it been dispatched repeatedly with
no progress? is its watch_id even valid?), which of the six verdicts does this watch get —

    misconfig   permanently stuck; hold and page a human (bad watch_id, no checker,
                error/no-progress promoted past its threshold)
    backoff     a transient checker error inside its exponential-backoff window; hold
    skip        a transient/ratelimited upstream; hold and retry next tick, do NOT read as
                dirty (ratelimited reading as dirty is what makes a retry loop compound)
    hold        clean, but the checker could not prove it drained its window; cursor must not
                move or unseen older items are skipped
    dirty       genuinely new activity → dispatch
    clean       nothing new, window covered → advance

`classify()` is PURE: it takes the checker result and the watch's health/unacked state as data
and returns the verdict. It runs no checker, reads no file, writes nothing. That is what makes
the six-way routing — where the costly mistakes hide — unit-testable in isolation, which it
never was inside the shell.

The impure fan-out (running every checker in parallel, capped) lives in `run_checks()` and calls
classify() on each result. tick.py sequences it; the backoff/health bookkeeping stays with the
existing ledger/checker-health.py.

    """Rotate a STABLE list of quest ids forward by `cursor`, so the tick starts somewhere new.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. The Slack token has a finite request budget and a tick spends it in
    order. Whoever is at the back when it runs out gets a rate limit and is skipped — and
    with a fixed order, it is the SAME quests every tick, forever. A quest that sorts last can
    be rate-limited on every single tick, so messages to it go unseen for hours while quests
    near the front are checked every minute. The
    watermark is held so nothing is lost, but "not lost" is not "noticed".

    Rotation, not randomisation. Random order fixes starvation only on average: a quest can
    lose the draw many times running, so the worst case stays unbounded and irreproducible.
    Rotating by a persisted cursor makes the worst case a GUARANTEE — with N quests, every
    quest reaches the front within N ticks — and keeps a tick replayable, which the
    differential goldens depend on (they replay a recorded sequence and diff the result; a
    random order would make them flap).

    Semantics deliberately mirror dispatch/plan.py rotate(): [a,b,c] with cursor 1 → [b,c,a];
    an unbounded cursor is taken modulo the count; a negative, non-integer or unparseable
    cursor is treated as 0, because the dangerous outcome here is a crashed tick, not a
    slightly unfair order. Returns (order, next_cursor); next_cursor advances by one so the
    starting point walks the list one step per tick.
