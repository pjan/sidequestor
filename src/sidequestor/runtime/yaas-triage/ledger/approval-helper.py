approval-helper.py — manage entries in state/pending-approvals.json.

All reads and writes use an exclusive flock to prevent races between the
dashboard server (which writes "reviewed"/"cancelled") and the worker (which
writes new items and "executing"/"executed").

Sub-commands
────────────
write <json>
    Add a new pending_review item. Missing quest_id and the reserved reactions
    source are normalized to quest-inbox; an unknown explicit quest is rejected.
    Prints the generated approval ID on success.
    Prints nothing (exit 0) if an identical pending entry already exists
    (same quest_id + target.channel_id + target.thread_ts).
    Also appends an `approval` watch to the quest's watch.json (additive,
    idempotent) so triage re-dispatches the worker when the reviewer approves
    or sends the item back. This is done as part of `write` on purpose: an
    approval with no watch is invisible to triage and never re-surfaces.

enqueue-instruction <json>
    Add a dashboard-authorized manual instruction with status reviewed. Every
    call creates a distinct item; its generated id is the uniqueness boundary.
    The next locked tick arms its approval watch. Prints a JSON result.

arm-pending-instructions
    Arm queued manual instructions and retry explicitly unarmed approvals.
    Called by tick.py only after it has acquired the global triage lock.

ensure-inbox
    Idempotently create the permanent Inbox quest. Called by setup.sh.

migrate-inbox
    One-time migration of legacy blank/reaction approvals into Inbox.

start <id>
    Transition status pending_review|reviewed → executing.
    Prints "ok" on success.
    Prints "skip:<current_status>" if already executing/executed/cancelled.

answer <id> <json>
    Worker's response to a reviewer question (status needs_reply). <json> may
    carry: worker_reply (the answer text), message_text (a revised draft).
    Records both, appends the round to review_history, and flips status back to
    pending_review so the item re-surfaces on the dashboard for another review
    pass. Does NOT send. Prints "ok", or "skip:<status>" if not needs_reply.

done <id> [response_ts | result_url] [report]
  report: one line per action the instruction produced; lands in the review trail
    Transition executing → executed. Optionally records the Slack response_ts,
    or — for a Jira comment / GitHub PR comment / Gmail reply — pass the URL of
    the posted reply instead and it is stored as result_url so the dashboard can
    link to it. Prints "ok" on success.

abandon <id> <reason>
    Terminally cancel an executing manual instruction whose outcome cannot be
    reconciled safely. This prevents an expired lease from dispatching forever.

fail <id> <reason>
    Return an approval the worker could not process to pending_review and record
    the error for the operator. The approval will not dispatch again until reviewed.
