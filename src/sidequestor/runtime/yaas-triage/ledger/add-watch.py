add-watch.py — the only way to add a watch.

Why this exists
───────────────
`watch.json` has one invariant: triage owns every existing `last_checked_ts`, and the
worker may only APPEND. That invariant lived solely as prose in CLAUDE.md, and prose
does not stop an Edit tool call. It has been violated in production (the `threads[]`
versus `watches[]` dead drop, where appends went to a key nothing read).

So the raw Edit/Write path is now blocked by a PreToolUse hook, and this is the
supported path. New watches are append-only. Its sole existing-entry mutation is an
explicit, locked, monotonic activity refresh for an adopted Slack thread.

Usage
─────
  add-watch.py <quest_id> '<entry_json>'

  entry_json needs `type` plus that type's required fields, and `reason`.
  `last_checked_ts` should be the response_ts of the message you just sent (see
  `yaas-quest-dispatch` §3a) — pass it explicitly. If omitted, a slack_thread watch falls back
  to its own thread_ts, which is the documented behaviour for a draft with no send
  timestamp; every other type defaults to now.

Prints the assigned watch_id, or `skip:duplicate` if an equivalent watch already
exists (idempotent, so a retry is safe). A slack_thread caller may pass the transient
`refresh_activity: true` option; on a duplicate, the helper monotonically refreshes
that existing watch's `last_activity_ts` instead of appending another entry. Exits
non-zero on a validation failure, so a malformed watch is loud rather than silently
appended and never checked.

Retire an existing watch by persistent ID:
  add-watch.py retire <quest_id> <watch_id> '<reason>'

Retirement is atomic, refuses to race an active dispatch, and appends a
`watch_retired` event to the quest timeline. Repeating the same retirement is safe.
