ack-watch.py — per-dispatch acknowledgment ledger.

Why this exists
───────────────
`claude -p` exits 0 whenever the model completes its output normally, even if it
handled 3 of 5 dirty watches and quietly skipped the rest. Before this ledger,
triage advanced the watermark of every watch it had named in the dispatch on the
strength of that exit code alone, so unhandled activity was buried with no trace.

The ledger makes the commit evidence-based instead of exit-code-based: triage
opens a manifest listing exactly what was dispatched, the worker closes each item
by name, and triage advances only the items that were actually closed. Anything
unacked keeps its old watermark and re-surfaces on the next tick.

Manifest lives at state/triage/dispatch-<run_id>.json:

    {
      "run_id":      "run-20260805T091402Z-4711",
      "target":      "quest-foo-2026-04-28",
      "kind":        "quest",             # quest | reactions
      "created_utc": "2026-08-05T09:14:02Z",
      "items": [
        {"item_id": "watch-a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8", "type": "slack_thread",
         "status": "pending", "note": "", "acked_utc": null}
      ]
    }

`item_id` is a watch_id for quest dispatches and "<emoji>:<msg_ts>" for the
reactions dispatch, so one mechanism covers both.

Sub-commands
────────────
open <run_id> <target> <kind> <items_json>
    Create the manifest. <items_json> is a JSON array of objects carrying at
    least `item_id`; `type` is optional. Prints the manifest path.

ack <run_id> <item_id> <handled|nothing_to_do|blocked> [note]
    Close one item. This is the call the WORKER makes. Exits non-zero (and
    changes nothing) if the run or item is unknown, so a typo is loud rather
    than silently accepted as work done.

    handled       — you did the thing (replied, drafted, queued, adopted, logged)
    nothing_to_do — you read the new activity and it correctly needs no action
    blocked       — you could not complete it; watermark must be held

acked <run_id>
    Print the item_ids whose status is handled or nothing_to_do, one per line.
    This is what triage advances. Empty output means nothing was acked.

summary <run_id>
    Print one JSON object of counts, for logging.

prune [days]
    Delete manifests older than `days` (default 7).
