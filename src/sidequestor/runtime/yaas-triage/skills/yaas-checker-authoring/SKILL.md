description: Add a new watch type to the yaas triage loop by pairing an executable checkers/<type>.py with checkers/<type>.watch.json, then covering its behavior and affected docs. Load when asked to watch a source triage cannot watch yet (a new API, a queue, a feed), or when reviewing a checker someone else added.

# yaas-checker-authoring

A **checker** is one script that answers a single question for one watch entry: *has anything
happened on this since the watermark?* It runs on every tick, in Python, with no LLM. It is the
cheapest part of the system and the most dangerous: a checker that gets its answer wrong does
not throw, it just silently stops waking the worker, and nobody notices until someone asks why
a thread went unanswered for a day.

Two failure modes matter. Everything below exists to prevent one of them.

- **Silent data loss.** The watermark advances past activity that was never seen. The watch
  reports clean forever; the missed item never comes back.
- **Runaway cost.** The checker reports dirty when nothing happened, or holds forever, and
  every tick pays for an Opus dispatch. Unbounded, that compounds fast.

Read `checkers/result.py` before anything else. It is the contract, and it is short.

---

## 1. Decide whether you need a checker at all

Do not add one when:

- An existing type covers it with a `search`/`query`/`jql` narrowing. Prefer that.
- The thing you want fires on a clock, not on external change → use `schedule`.
- The source has no monotonic "last updated" field per item, and no cursor. Without one you
  cannot express a watermark, and everything below becomes guesswork. Find another surface
  (a webhook into a file, a feed, a search index) before writing a poller that diffs blobs.

A new type is justified when there is a **distinct external surface** with its own auth, its
own pagination, and its own idea of time.

---

## 2. Write `checkers/<type>.py`

Copy the closest sibling rather than starting blank — the doctrine below is already encoded in
`github_pr.py` (a bounded search index) and `slack_thread.py` + `slack_utils.py` (a paginated
conversation). Copying is also how doctrine rots, so §4 asks you to re-assert it in tests
instead of trusting the sibling's suite.

**Interface.** `argv[1]` is the watch entry as JSON, including `last_checked_ts`. Print exactly
one line of `result.py` JSON to stdout. Exit code is ignored; the line is everything. The file
must be executable (`chmod +x`) or triage classifies every watch of that type as misconfig and
freezes its watermark — silently, forever.

**Outcomes, and what each one costs.** Only `dirty` spends money.

| Outcome | Means | Triage does |
|---|---|---|
| `clean` | nothing new, window fully covered | advances the watermark |
| `dirty` | N new items | advances, then dispatches a worker |
| `hold` | cannot prove the window was drained | holds the watermark, no dispatch |
| `ratelimited` | transient upstream (429, 5xx, timeout, reset) | skips the tick, holds |
| `error` | hard failure, might be retryable | exponential backoff |
| `misconfig` | permanent, needs a human | holds and pages |

Classifying a transient as `error` costs you the backoff window. Classifying it as `clean` is
data loss. Classifying a permanent condition (bad credential, missing repo, deleted channel) as
`error` burns a day of retries before it is promoted to misconfig anyway — send those straight
to `misconfig` with a reason that names the fix.

**The watermark rules.** These are the ones that were learned the expensive way:

1. **Bound the low end of the query and sort ASCENDING.** A "newest N" query on a busy source
   returns a *suffix* of the unread gap, and a watermark can never cross a suffix — the unread
   part sits directly above it. Bounding low and sorting ascending makes the page a *prefix*,
   which is committable. This is the exact bug that parked a `github_pr` watch for 14 hours
   across 424 misconfigured events (2026-08-05).
2. **`complete: true` means "everything up to `advance_to` was seen"**, not "the whole backlog
   is done". Reporting `complete: false` on a safe prefix recreates the stall with code that
   looks right. `slack_utils.drain()` uses the same convention.
3. **Never advance onto a timestamp you may hold only partially.** If the page saturated at
   `limit`, the boundary row's timestamp may have more rows you never saw. Advance strictly
   *below* it, or `hold` if that leaves nothing.
4. **Re-apply the exact boundary in code.** Most upstream `since`/`updated:>=` filters are
   inclusive and coarse (whole seconds), so rows at or below the watermark come back. Filter
   them out yourself; do not trust the server's `>`.
5. **Prove monotonicity.** Feed tick N's `advance_to` back in as tick N+1's watermark and
   assert it goes strictly up. A checker that cannot advance is a livelock that looks healthy.

**Pre-dispatch filters.** If the type can wake the worker on things nobody cares about, accept
filter fields (`filter_user_ids`, `filter_keywords` on the Slack types) and evaluate them
*inside the checker*. A rejection there is free; a rejection after dispatch costs a model
round-trip. Note in the docstring that extra watch fields are passed through unvalidated, so a
misspelled filter key is silently ignored.

**Credentials.** Never mutate global auth state (`gh auth switch`, writing a config file, or
exporting into the parent env) — the tick runs many checkers in one process tree and the next
one inherits your mess. Resolve a credential per subprocess and pass it in that subprocess's
`env` only. Never let it reach stdout: the result line goes into the log.

**Argument injection.** If a watch field is spliced into a command line, treat it as hostile
even though a human wrote it. Refuse anything that could become a flag rather than a value,
and refuse it as `misconfig` before invoking the tool. A `search` string that smuggles
`--include-prs` into an issues query silently doubles both the reports and the bill.

**`<type>.lag`.** Optional file next to the checker holding one integer: seconds to hold back
the watermark, for sources whose index is eventually consistent (`github_pr` and
`github_issue` = 30, `email` = 120, `slack_mention` = 90, `jira` = 15). Missing file means 0.
Keep it as small as the source allows: every second of lag widens the window in which an item
is reported twice.

---

## 3. Registration — all of it, or the type is broken in a way nothing catches

A checker file alone does nothing, but the registration is now **two files**, not a dozen. The
manifest is the single declaration; everything else derives from it by glob.

| File | What to add | If you skip it |
|---|---|---|
| `checkers/<type>.py` | the checker, **executable** | every watch of the type is misconfig |
| `checkers/<type>.watch.json` | the manifest, see below | the bijection test fails; nothing can use the type |
| `checkers/<type>.lag` | integer seconds, if the source lags | duplicate reports, or missed items |

The manifest carries `schema_version`, `required` (an AND-of-OR list), `identity`,
`checker_example`, `open_loop`, `user_creatable` and `upstream`.

**Derived automatically. Do not hand-edit these; they used to be separate lists and are not
any more:**

| Consumer | Reads |
|---|---|
| `ledger/add-watch.py` | `required` + `identity` via `load_watch_manifests` |
| `skills/yaas-quest-creation/new-quest.py` | `required` + `user_creatable` |
| `ops/dashboard-server.py` | `open_loop`, for the open-items display |
| `tests/lib/scenario.py` | the type set |
| `tests/behaviour/checker-contract.test.sh` | `checker_example`, via `entry_for()` |

**Still hand-maintained, but under contract:** the watch-type tables in `README.md` and
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, the `.lag` values in `yaas-ops/SKILL.md`, and the creation guidance in
`yaas-quest-creation/SKILL.md`. `tests/behaviour/doc-contracts.test.sh` fails with the exact file
and expectation if you add a type or change a `.lag` value without updating them.

**On `identity`:** think about it rather than copying the sibling. Both GitHub watch types include
`repo`, `search`, and `gh_account`, because different qualifiers or credentials produce genuinely
different result sets and collapsing them would drop one. Optional string identity fields are
trimmed, and empty strings are treated as absent, before duplicate detection.

**Rule: Slack-backed types MUST be named `slack_*`.** `tick.py` and `tick_dispatch.py` still group
Slack types by the `startswith("slack_")` prefix rather than by the manifest's `upstream` field,
and `tests/behaviour/checker-contract.test.sh` enforces that the two agree in both directions. This
is deliberate because loading manifests in the tick hot path would give every 60s liveness pass a
hard dependency on those files, but it means the name is still part of the contract for Slack.

---

## 4. Tests — what a checker has to prove

Suites live at `tests/unit/checkers/<type>.test.sh`, mirroring the source path.
`tests/coverage.sh` reports any source file with no test at the matching path; it does not fail
the build, so a missing suite is visible but not blocking — write it anyway.
`tests/run-all.sh` runs everything. Copy the harness (`_find_triage`, `ok`/`bad`/`eq`, a fake
binary on `$PATH` via `GH_BIN`-style indirection) from `github_pr.test.sh` or
`github_issue.test.sh`.

**Fake the external binary, and assert the query it was given.** The query shape *is* the
watermark fix, so record argv and grep it. Asserting only on counts passes happily while the
query has been "simplified" back into a suffix scan.

Every checker suite should cover, at minimum:

- **Query shape** — bounded low, ascending, boundary backed off by the source's granularity.
- **Full page, distinct timestamps** — `complete: true`, `advance_to` strictly below the final
  row, count limited to the safe prefix, backlog surfaced in the preview.
- **Short page** — drained, no backlog claim.
- **Monotonic advance** — tick 2 starts strictly above tick 1.
- **Tie safety, both shapes** — a full page whose new rows share one timestamp → `hold`; a full
  page with *nothing* past the watermark → `hold`, never `clean` (this is the dangerous one:
  clean here lets triage jump to now-minus-lag and skip the whole backlog).
- **Empty result** — `clean`, and specifically *not* an error. Check how the tool signals empty:
  `gh --json` prints `[]`, so a blank-stdout check would misread it.
- **Boundary re-filter** — a row at or below the watermark is dropped.
- **Failure classification** — one case each for transient → `ratelimited`, permanent →
  `misconfig`, unknown → `error`.
- **Credential handling, if any** — the token reaches the call that needs it and no other, never
  appears in the emitted line, and global auth state is untouched.
- **Injection, if any field reaches a command line** — refused as `misconfig`, *before* the
  tool is invoked (assert the fake binary was never called).

Then run the wider suites, because they exercise the manifest registry and dispatch behavior:
`tests/behaviour/checker-contract.test.sh` (every checker honours the contract on both a
plausible and a nonsense entry, and reports no `AttributeError`/`NameError`-class bug),
`tests/behaviour/dirty-watch-dispatch.test.sh`, and `tests/run-all.sh`.

Finally, run it **against the real source once** with a recent watermark and eyeball the
output. Fakes agree with whatever you believed when you wrote them.

---

## 5. Documentation — the tree that goes stale

All of these are in the public `yaas-v2` mirror, and each is read by someone (or some future
session) deciding whether the type exists. Update them in the same commit as the checker:

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | the watch-type table, above the result contract |
| `README.md` | the short "things you can watch" table |
| `yaas-triage/skills/yaas-ops/SKILL.md` | the `checkers/` tree diagram, the `.lag` list, the example watch entry, and the per-type option notes |
| `yaas-triage/skills/yaas-quest-creation/SKILL.md` | the watch-type list the creation flow offers, with its traps |
| `checkers/<type>.watch.json` | the manifest fields and whether quest creation offers the type |
| `yaas-triage/skills/yaas-quest-dispatch/SKILL.md` | **what a worker should DO when this type fires** — the commands to read the item, and the out-of-scope rule |
| the checker's own module docstring | the real reference: every option, every trap, and the incident that motivated each rule |

The dispatch skill is the one people forget. A watch type with no entry there fires correctly
and then the worker has to improvise what to do about it, at Opus prices, every time.

Sanity check before committing, in a source checkout: run the repository's
`tests/behaviour/doc-contracts.test.sh`. It fails with the exact stale doc file and expected contract when a new type or lag value is missing from
the maintained tables in `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `yaas-ops/SKILL.md`, or
`yaas-quest-creation/SKILL.md`.

## 6. Review it adversarially before trusting it

A checker is ~200 lines that runs unattended every 60 seconds against money and other people's
attention. Get a second model to review it (`codex exec` works well headless) and point the
review at the two failure modes explicitly rather than asking for general feedback — ask
whether any path can advance a watermark past unseen activity, whether transients can be
misread as clean or permanent conditions as retryable, and whether any field can escape into
the command line. The `github_issue` review that way surfaced both a flag-injection path and a
misclassified 404 that the author's own tests had not thought to cover.

---

## 7. Rollout

New watches start their watermark at creation time, so an existing backlog will **not** fire.
Say so explicitly when you hand the quest over — the difference between "watching" and "caught
up" is exactly the kind of thing a user assumes the other way.

Then watch the first real tick: `DRY_RUN=1 sq tick` proves the checker is
wired in and clean; `logs/` and the dashboard show what it does once it is live.
