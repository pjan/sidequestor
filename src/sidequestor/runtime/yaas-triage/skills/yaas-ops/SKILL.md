## Checker plugin architecture

### How it works

The orchestrator's `check_quest` (`tick.py`, ported from the original shell orchestrator) iterates over every entry in a quest's `watches[]` array. For each entry it looks up `$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/checkers/<type>.py` and runs it:

```
python3 "$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/checkers/<type>.py" '<watch_entry_json>'
```

The checker outputs one line to stdout:

| Output | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0\|` | Nothing new — clean |
| `N\|<preview>` | N new items — quest is dirty, dispatch worker |
| `error\|<reason>` | Failure (network, API error, malformed response) — treat as dirty so worker retries |

For Slack checkers specifically: a non-JSON response is treated as `error|` and surfaces in the log, except for the carve-outs `thread_not_found` / `channel_not_found` (permanent conditions) which return `0|`.

Environment variables available to all checkers (exported by the orchestrator after merging `.env`):
- `MCP_CALL` — path to `mcp-call.sh`
- `GWS_BIN` — path to `gws` CLI

### The reactions sweep

`checkers/reactions.py` is special — it doesn't follow the per-entry interface. It runs once per triage tick (called directly by the orchestrator with 4 positional args) and sweeps Slack globally for the configured process, draft, save, and adopt reactions across a 60-day window. `.env.example` lists their defaults and override variables. The configured names still map to fixed semantic state files under `state/`. New reactions → writes `state/triage/pending_reactions.json`.

### Watermark lag

If a channel type has indexing latency (e.g. Gmail's search index takes ~60s to reflect new mail), create a companion file `checkers/<type>.lag` containing the lag in integer seconds. the orchestrator reads these at startup and subtracts the lag when advancing watermarks, so clean ticks never claim "I've seen everything up to now" when the source hasn't indexed it yet.

Currently: `email.lag = 120` (Gmail's index is slow), `slack_mention.lag = 90`,
`github_pr.lag = 30`, `github_issue.lag = 30`, `telegram_chat.lag = 2`, `telegram_search.lag = 30`,
`x_search.lag = 30`, `x_mentions.lag = 30`, `x_user_posts.lag = 30`, `x_home.lag = 30`,
`x_dm.lag = 30`, and `jira.lag = 15`. Types with no
`.lag` file get lag = 0.

Keep the lag as small as the source allows. Every second of lag widens the window in which an already-seen change gets re-reported, and each re-report costs a full dispatch that finds nothing. Note `*.lag` is gitignored, so a fresh clone starts at lag 0 for every type; recreate them from the values above.

### watch.json schema

```json
{
  "watches": [
    {"type": "slack_thread",  "channel_id": "C...", "thread_ts": "1234.567", "last_checked_ts": "0", "reason": "..."},
    {"type": "slack_channel", "channel_id": "C...", "last_checked_ts": "0", "reason": "..."},
    {"type": "slack_dm",      "channel_id": "D...", "user_id": "U...", "last_checked_ts": "0", "reason": "..."},
    {"type": "slack_mention", "user_id": "U...",    "last_checked_ts": "0", "reason": "..."},
    {"type": "schedule",      "cron": "0 9 * * 1", "tz": "Asia/Singapore", "last_checked_ts": "0", "reason": "..."},
    {"type": "email",         "query": "from:partner@company.com subject:Re:", "last_checked_ts": "0", "reason": "..."},

    {"type": "telegram_search", "peer": "@channel", "query": "release", "last_checked_ts": "1770000000", "reason": "..."},
    {"type": "x_search",      "query": "from:XDevelopers", "last_checked_ts": "1770000000", "reason": "..."},
    {"type": "x_mentions",    "credential_id": "default", "last_checked_ts": "1770000000", "reason": "..."},
    {"type": "x_user_posts",  "user_id": "2244994945", "last_checked_ts": "1770000000", "reason": "..."},
    {"type": "x_home",        "credential_id": "default", "last_checked_ts": "1770000000", "reason": "..."},
    {"type": "x_dm",          "credential_id": "default", "last_checked_ts": "1770000000", "reason": "..."}
  ]
}
```

`jira` needs the REST bridge (`$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/surfaces/jira-call.sh`, Basic-auth API token in Keychain `jira-api-token`/`yaas`) because the Atlassian MCP is interactive-OAuth only and is absent in headless dispatch. `github_pr` and `github_issue` both accept optional `search` (extra GitHub qualifiers), `limit` (default 100), and `gh_account` (a `gh` login whose token to use, for a repo the ACTIVE `gh` account cannot see; resolved per-run via `gh auth token -u`, never persisted). Read the warning in `checkers/github_pr.py`'s docstring before adding a `search`, since repeated qualifiers AND rather than OR and can silently match nothing. A `search` may contain qualifiers only: anything starting with `-` is refused as `misconfig`, because the string is spliced into argv ahead of gh's own flags and e.g. `--include-prs` would make a `github_issue` watch double-report every PR against a `github_pr` watch on the same repo.

`.lag` note: `github_issue.lag = 30`, same as `github_pr` and for the same reason (GitHub's search index is eventually consistent).

`last_checked_ts` is always a Unix epoch float string. The orchestrator is the sole owner of this field — the worker must never modify existing entries (it may only append new ones).

In an interactive session, retire an obsolete entry by persistent ID with
`sq watch retire <quest_id> <watch_id> "<reason>"`. The helper shares the triage lock, removes
exactly one watch atomically, and records `watch_retired` in the quest timeline. It refuses to
run during a tick. There is no replace command; retire the old watch, then add the new one.

Old quests may carry six dead arrays at the bottom (`threads`, `dm_partners`, `channels`, `schedules`, `emails`, `reactions`) — harmless legacy. New quests created via `new-quest.py` only have `watches[]`.

### meta.json schema

```json
{
  "id": "quest-...",                           // must match folder name
  "title": "...",
  "status": "active",                          // active | awaiting_reply | blocked | completed | cancelled
  "created": "2026-...T...Z",
  "priority": "normal",                        // high | normal | low
  "allow_send": false,                         // true = worker can send directly
  "retire_slack_threads_after_days": 14        // optional; int / false / null — see ARCHITECTURE.md §6
}
```

## Telegram and X credentials

Telegram uses the authorized user's cloud history, not a bot update queue. Run
`sq telegram-auth authorize API_ID [CREDENTIAL_ID]`; the phone number and API hash are prompted without echo,
and the Telethon `StringSession` is stored in macOS Keychain. `telegram_chat` accepts `peer` plus
optional `filter_sender_ids`, `filter_keywords`, `filter_kinds`, `include_outgoing`, and `limit`.
Both types accept `from_user` as an @username; `telegram_search` additionally requires `query`.
Quest replies can be drafted through `sq telegram-send --peer ... --message ... [--quest-id ...]`;
the helper logs `message_text` automatically when `quest_id` is present. It saves a native Telegram
cloud draft by default. Pass `--send` to deliver instead. Quest-owned sends require
`allow_send: true` or an exact claimed approval, and dispatched sends require a unique idempotency
key.
Secret Chats
and later edits/deletes/reactions are not observable through these history-window checkers.

For X, configure a public/native OAuth 2.0 Developer App with callback
`http://127.0.0.1:8765/callback`, then run `sq x-auth authorize CLIENT_ID [CREDENTIAL_ID]`.
The browser consent grants user-level access and Keychain stores the rotating token pair. Use
`sq x-auth status` to inspect the account and scopes or `sq x-auth revoke` to revoke it. App-only
bearer tokens are rejected. `x_search`, `x_mentions`, `x_user_posts`, `x_home`, and `x_dm` cover
recent search, mentions, selected accounts, the home timeline, and incoming DMs. X API reads are
billable, and DMs are limited to the API's 30-day history window.

`sq x-send` acts as the authorized account. It supports posts, replies, threads, DMs, media uploads,
post deletion, likes, reposts, bookmarks, follows, mutes, blocks, and their inverse actions. Active
quests need `allow_send: true` or an exact claimed `remote_request` approval. Dispatched writes need
an `idempotency_key`; a started key is never retried automatically after an uncertain interruption.

Authentication alone does not activate polling. Add `telegram` and/or `x` to
`SIDEQUESTOR_CHECKER_CONNECTORS` in the workspace `.env`. The default is
`slack,email,github,jira`; connector-disabled watches stay stored with frozen watermarks. An
unknown or repeated connector name is rejected by `setup.sh` and reported by `doctor.sh`, because
`tick.py` exits 2 on it.

Two consequences of freezing a watermark are worth knowing. X recent search serves only the last
seven days, so a watch whose cursor falls behind that floor is clamped forward to it and reports
`skipped Ns of unrecoverable history` on the next row — the interval is gone either way, and
clamping is what lets the watch resume at all. Telegram instead catches up in 24-hour windows, one
per tick, until it reaches the present. Resolving a *numeric* Telegram peer requires enumerating
the authorized user's dialogs, so the resolved identity is cached in
`state/telegram-peers.json`, keyed by `credential_id`; deleting that file only costs one dialog
scan per peer to rebuild.

## Worker utilities

### `$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/ledger/approval-helper.py`

Besides ordinary review drafts, the approval ledger carries dashboard-submitted manual quest
instructions. `enqueue-instruction <json>` durably records one distinct reviewed item without
touching `watch.json`; `tick.py` calls `arm-pending-instructions` under the global triage lock on
the next cycle. Workers claim with `start`, close successful work with `done`, and use
`abandon <id> <reason>` only when an expired manual-instruction lease makes the outcome uncertain.

### `$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/skills/yaas-gmail-reply/gmail-reply.py`

Builds a threaded Gmail reply (RFC 2822 `In-Reply-To` + `References` headers) and sends via `gws gmail users messages send`. Used by quests that watch email and need to reply in-thread.

```bash
GWS_BIN="${GWS_BIN:-$(command -v gws)}" \
  python3 "$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/skills/yaas-gmail-reply/gmail-reply.py" <gmail_message_id> --body "<reply text>"
# Prints sent message ID on success, exits 1 on failure.
```

Reads `SIDEQUESTOR_FROM_EMAIL` from env for the From header. See `.yaas/engine/current/skills/yaas-gmail-reply/SKILL.md`.

### `$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/skills/yaas-quest-creation/new-quest.py`

Deterministic quest scaffolding. Takes a JSON spec on argv or stdin, creates the four-file folder under `state/quests/active/`, validates fields, injects `last_checked_ts` so the worker can never forget it. See `.yaas/engine/current/skills/yaas-quest-creation/SKILL.md`.

### `sq gdoc-comment`

Adds real text-anchored Google Doc comments through a dedicated Chrome profile and Playwright.
The writer enforces active-quest scope, `allow_send` or an exact claimed approval, dispatch
idempotency, exclusive browser access, Drive verification, and quest timeline logging. Every write
requires an idempotency key. One
exact-case anchor is accepted per idempotency key, avoiding partial multi-comment writes. The `gws` CLI
must be installed and authenticated with Drive access. The capability is enabled by default and
can be disabled workspace-wide with
`SIDEQUESTOR_GDOC_COMMENTS_ENABLED=0`. See
`.yaas/engine/current/skills/yaas-gdoc-anchored-comments/SKILL.md`.

---

## Setup (first time or new colleague)

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd <repo>
cp .env.example .env             # configure the adapters you use
bash "$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/setup/setup.sh"
bash "$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/ops/doctor.sh"          # is this machine configured (real creds, PATH, plist)
python3 "$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/ops/health-monitor.py"   # is it working right now
bash "$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/tests/run-all.sh"     # is the code correct (fixtures, safe any time)
```

With local Slack checking enabled, `setup.sh` walks through Slack OAuth (PKCE flow, no client secret needed), stores the complete rotating user-token bundle
in macOS Keychain at `(service=slack-oauth-token-bundle, account=yaas)`, runs a connectivity check,
and offers the triage, independent heartbeat, and dashboard launchd jobs. It can also initialize
opt-in daily template tracking and run verification. Each user creates their own Slack app at
https://api.slack.com/apps from the manifest printed by `setup.sh --manifest`; the manifest and
OAuth flow share `setup/yaas-app-config.json`, so their scopes cannot drift.

The deterministic Slack adapter refreshes within five minutes of access-token expiry. It also
refreshes and retries once after a definitive token rejection. `python3 "$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/surfaces/slack_credentials.py" status`
reports redacted credential health; `refresh-now` performs an immediate manual rotation.

Remove `slack` from `SIDEQUESTOR_CHECKER_CONNECTORS` when no local Slack app is available. The
legacy `SIDEQUESTOR_SLACK_CHECKERS_ENABLED=0` setting is an additional Slack-only kill switch.
Setup and doctor then
treat Slack app fields and the Keychain token as intentionally absent. The tick skips all
`slack_*` checker entries and the global reaction sweep without advancing their watermarks;
schedule and non-Slack checks continue, and paid workers retain their own MCP access.

For the interim paid-sweep pattern, give the quest a recurring `schedule` watch and state in its
`context.md` that the schedule must inspect the quest's dormant `slack_*` entries through Slack
MCP. The schedule watch's watermark is the shared sweep cursor. The worker must block that
schedule acknowledgement if any required Slack read fails, so the window is retried rather than
skipped. This is intentionally quest-scoped; a dispatch never scans other quests' folders.

### Manual launchd control

```bash
sq stop                    # temporarily stop this workspace's Sidequestor jobs
sq start                   # start triage, heartbeat, and dashboard; labels are instance-specific
sq doctor                  # inspect all three package-owned launchd jobs

DRY_RUN=1 VERBOSE=1 sq tick   # one tick, no dispatch

tail -f logs/triage.log
tail -f logs/worker-latest.log
```

The legacy `setup/install-launchd*.sh` scripts install fixed `com.yaas.*` labels and are not
used by the package lifecycle; do not run them for a Sidequestor workspace.

## Configurable knobs (in `.env`)

`.env.example` is the canonical list with full reasoning. The knobs most likely to
come up while debugging:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SIDEQUESTOR_CHECKER_CONNECTORS` | `slack,email,github,jira` | Comma-separated external connectors allowed to poll. Add `telegram` and `x` explicitly after authentication. Disabled connector watches and watermarks are preserved. Local schedule/approval checks always run. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_SLACK_CHECKERS_ENABLED` | 1 | `0` disables all local `slack_*` Python checks and the reaction sweep. Slack watermarks are held; schedules and worker MCP access are unaffected. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_GDOC_COMMENTS_ENABLED` | 1 | `0` disables the guarded external-write surface for text-anchored Google Doc comments. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_MAX_SPEND_1H` | 40 | Hourly dollar ceiling. On breach, checks still run but the dispatch is withheld and `gate_budget_exceeded` is logged. This is the first thing to check when nothing is dispatching despite dirty quests. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_MAX_SPEND_24H` | 250 | Daily dollar ceiling. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_MAX_DISPATCH_6H` | 250 | Dispatch-count ceiling. The only ceiling that works under the codex/cursor backends, which report no cost. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_MAX_TARGET_DISPATCH_PER_HOUR` | 25 | Per-target breaker; logs `gate_target_breaker_open`. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_MAX_DISPATCH_FANOUT` | 4 | Max agent invocations per tick. Extra targets are deferred (`gate_dispatch_deferred`) with watermarks untouched. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_UNACKED_PROMOTE` | 3 | Dispatches a watch may go unacked in the ledger before it starts backing off (5m doubling to a 24h cap). It keeps retrying forever and is never parked; the dashboard shows it as `backing off` with the worker's last error. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_APPROVAL_LEASE_MIN` | 45 | Minutes a worker approval lease remains claimable before the dashboard can reclaim it. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_CHECKER_ERROR_PROMOTE` | 6 | Consecutive checker errors before backoff becomes `misconfig`. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_TRIAGE_MAX_PARALLEL` | 1 | Peak concurrent Slack calls. Raising this makes rate-limit trips much more likely. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_LOG_RETAIN_DAYS` | 14 | Per-dispatch worker logs older than N days are deleted each tick. `0` disables. |
| `SIDEQUESTOR_RETIRE_DEFAULT_DAYS` | 14 | Default age threshold for retiring stale `slack_thread` watches. Per-quest override via `retire_slack_threads_after_days` in meta.json (`false` or `0` = never). |

Current spend against the ceilings:
`python3 "$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/dispatch/spend-window.py" state/run-log.ndjson | jq .`

---

## Debugging

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Quest never fires | `DRY_RUN=1 VERBOSE=1 sq tick` — see per-type checker output |
| Checker returns `0\|` when it should find messages | Run checker directly: `MCP_CALL="$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/surfaces/mcp-call.sh" python3 "$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/checkers/slack_thread.py" '<entry_json>'` |
| Email quest misses messages | Watermark too far ahead? Check `watches[].last_checked_ts` in the quest's `watch.json`. Gmail indexes ~60s after delivery; `email.lag=120` gives a 2-min buffer |
| Worker keeps retrying the same error | Check `logs/worker-latest.log` and the watch's checker-health entry. Never delete an existing watch by hand; resolve or archive the quest, or change its objective through the supported quest workflow. |
| Triage lock stuck | Check `logs/triage.lock.holder`. If PID is dead, the OS releases the lock automatically on next tick |
| `LastExitStatus = 512` on launchd | Exit code 2 — a bad `.env` knob (a spend/limit value that isn't numeric) makes the orchestrator refuse to run (`gate_bad_env_knob`). Fix the value in `.env`; run `sq tick` manually to see it. (The old bash orchestrator exited 2 the same way on `.env` syntax errors under `set -eu`.) |
| `LastExitStatus = 36608` on launchd | Exit 143 (SIGTERM). Expected if the worker watchdog killed a runaway dispatch; or if macOS slept mid-run. |
