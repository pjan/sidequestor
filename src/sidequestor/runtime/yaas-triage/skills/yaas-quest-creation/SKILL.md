description: Scaffold a new quest folder under state/quests/active/. Use this when the user wants to start tracking a Slack thread, a reaction-triggered follow-up, or an ongoing conversation with a specific person. Invoke interactively — ask the user for title and watch targets, then create the 4-file quest folder. Does NOT create a quest without user confirmation.

# yaas-quest-creation

Scaffold a new yaas quest. A quest is a folder under `state/quests/active/` containing exactly four files. This skill creates that folder with correctly-shaped content and tells the user what was created.

## When to invoke

- User says "track this thread", "let's make a quest for X", "I want to follow up on Y"
- User pastes a Slack permalink and asks to be reminded when someone replies
- User mentions a recurring conversation they want the triage loop to monitor

## When NOT to invoke

- If the user is just asking a question about a thread
- If the task can be completed inside the current session (no follow-up needed)
- If the user is updating an existing quest — use the locking helpers and Mode B coexistence
  rules from `yaas-quest-dispatch`; never hand-edit shared JSON

## Run loop

### 1. Gather inputs interactively

Ask the user for, in order:

1. **Title** — one short line, used both as the display name and to generate the quest ID slug.
2. **What to watch** — at least one entry, each with a `type`:
   - **`slack_thread`** — provide Slack permalink(s). Extract `channel_id` and `thread_ts` from each URL. Use when watching a specific thread for new replies.
   - **`slack_channel`** — provide channel name or ID. Watches entire channel for new top-level messages. Does NOT catch replies inside existing threads; for those, add the specific thread as `slack_thread`.
   - **`slack_dm`** — needs BOTH `user_id` and `channel_id` (the DM channel, `D…`). Resolve a name → user ID via `mcp__slack__slack_search_users`, then resolve that user's DM channel; a `user_id` is not a channel. Fires on new DMs from that person.
   - **`slack_mention`** — a Slack `user_id`. Fires on any new message that @mentions that user, anywhere the searcher can see (global, not channel-scoped). No channel field; the worker re-runs the mention search to locate each hit. Use for "back me up: respond when anyone @mentions me." Skips `[BOT]` authors and the watched user's own messages.
   - **`schedule`** — fires the quest at a time you choose, in one of two shapes:
     - **repeating**: `cron` (5-field) + `tz` (IANA timezone). `tz` is required alongside `cron` — a bare cron is ambiguous.
     - **one-shot**: `next_fire_ts` (epoch seconds), and no `cron`. Fires once, then the watch is spent.
     Cron cannot express "every other week" and similar; for those, schedule the inner interval and have `context.md` gate on a state file the worker writes after it acts.
   - **`email`** — field name is `query` (a Gmail search string, e.g. `from:partner@example.com subject:invoice`). Matches any email matching the query that arrived after the watermark.
   - **`jira`** — a JQL string (e.g. `labels=my-label`, `project=PROJ AND assignee=currentUser()`). Fires when any issue in that set changes: status transition, new comment, or any field edit. Reads through the packaged bridge at `$SIDEQUESTOR_RUNTIME_ROOT/yaas-triage/surfaces/jira-call.sh`, so it works headless (the Atlassian MCP does not). Requires the Keychain API token `jira-api-token`/`yaas`. Do NOT include `ORDER BY` in the JQL: the checker adds its own ordering, and a caller-supplied one disables its early stop and makes every tick page to the cap.
   - **`github_pr`** — a `repo` as `owner/name`. Fires on any PR update in that repo: new PR, new commit, review, comment, or merge. Use it alongside `jira` when a fix lands as a PR, because **a PR review comment does not bump the linked Jira issue**, so the `jira` watch cannot see it. Optional `search` (extra GitHub qualifiers) and `limit` (default 100). Two traps before you add a `search`: repeated qualifiers AND rather than OR (`author:a author:b` matches nothing and the watch reports clean forever), and full-text terms only match what a PR happens to say. Also avoid `is:open`, which hides merges. Verify recall against a known PR set first; the details are in `checkers/github_pr.py`'s docstring.

   - **`github_issue`** — a `repo` as `owner/name`. Fires on any issue update in that repo: new issue, comment, label change, close. Pull requests are excluded (`gh search issues` omits them unless asked), so it never double-reports with `github_pr` — pair the two when you want both halves. Optional `search` (extra qualifiers, same AND-not-OR trap as `github_pr`), `limit` (default 100), and `gh_account` (a `gh` login whose token to use, for a private repo the ACTIVE `gh` account cannot see; resolved per-run via `gh auth token -u`, never persisted).
   - **`telegram_chat`** — a Telegram cloud-chat `peer`: use its `@username`/public link when available, or its numeric dialog ID for private chats. Reads as the user authorized by `sq telegram-auth`, not as a bot. Optional `credential_id`, `from_user` (an `@username`), `filter_sender_ids`, `filter_keywords`, `filter_kinds`, `include_outgoing`, and `limit`. Detects new messages only; it cannot see Secret Chats or reliably detect later edits, deletions, or reactions.
   - **`telegram_search`** — a `peer` plus non-empty `query`, with the same optional filters as `telegram_chat` and optional `from_user`. Search is index-backed and deliberately trails the current time by 30 seconds.
   - **`x_search`** — an X recent-search `query` (maximum 1024 characters). Use `@handle` for mentions or `from:handle` for an author's posts. Optional `credential_id`, `filter_keywords`, and `exclude_user_ids`. Broad searches incur API read charges; narrow at the source and with checker filters.
   - **`x_mentions`** — mentions of the authorized X account. `credential_id` is required. Optional `user_id`, `filter_keywords`, and `exclude_user_ids`.
   - **`x_user_posts`** — posts from one selected X `user_id`. Optional `credential_id`, `exclude_replies`, `exclude_reposts`, `filter_keywords`, and `exclude_user_ids`.
   - **`x_home`** — the authorized account's reverse-chronological home timeline. `credential_id` is required. Optional `filter_keywords` and `exclude_user_ids`.
   - **`x_dm`** — incoming X direct messages visible to the authorized account. `credential_id` is required. Optional `conversation_id`, `participant_id`, and `filter_keywords`; omit both selectors to watch all accessible conversations. X exposes only the last 30 days of DM events.

   External watches run only when their connector is present in
   `SIDEQUESTOR_CHECKER_CONNECTORS`. The default is `slack,email,github,jira`; adding a Telegram
   or X watch without enabling its connector intentionally leaves its watermark frozen.

   GitHub and broad Telegram/X searches can fire on items unrelated to the quest. Say so in the `reason`, and make the quest's `context.md` tell the worker to exit immediately without acting when the changed item is out of scope.
   - **`approval`** — effectively runtime-only: the worker appends one itself when it queues a manual-review item (§3c of the `yaas-quest-dispatch` skill). Do not put one in a creation spec — there is no approval to track before the quest exists. `new-quest.py` does accept the type (with a required `approval_id`) so its type list matches `checkers/`, so this is a rule you follow, not one the script enforces.
   - **Anything else** — there is no other type. `new-quest.py` rejects a type with no
     `checkers/<type>.py`, because an unknown type would otherwise scaffold cleanly and then be
     skipped silently on every tick. To add one, write the checker first, then add
     `checkers/<type>.watch.json` beside it so the manifest defines the required fields.
     `.yaas/engine/current/skills/yaas-ops/SKILL.md` has the state-file reference.

   **Prefer a pre-dispatch filter over waking Opus to decide relevance.** `slack_channel`
   and `slack_thread` watches accept two optional filter fields, evaluated inside the
   checker scripts (not the orchestrator) before the worker is woken — so a non-matching message costs nothing:
   - **`filter_user_ids`** — list of Slack user IDs; only messages authored by one of
     them wake the worker.
   - **`filter_keywords`** — list of strings; a message must contain at least one
     (case-insensitive **substring** match) to wake the worker.

   When both are set they are AND-ed (right author AND a keyword hit). Use these whenever
   the quest is "watch channel X for person Y saying Z" — e.g. a command prefix
   (`filter_keywords: ["/add-josh-safely"]`), a person's posts on a topic, or an alerting
   keyword set. Without them the worker wakes on every channel message and pays a model
   round-trip just to reject it. Reference: any quest of the form `watch channel X for person Y saying Z`.

   Two cautions: (a) substring match means `filter_keywords: ["/cmd"]` also matches a
   message that merely mentions `/cmd` mid-sentence, so if you need a true prefix, re-check
   `startswith` in the worker after wake; (b) extra watch fields are passed through
   verbatim and NOT validated, so a typo like `filter_keyword` (singular) is silently
   written and silently ignored — spell them exactly.

   **Note:** reaction-workflow triggers (`process`, `draft`, `save`, and `adopt`) are tracked globally by the triage orchestrator and are NOT a per-quest watch input. Do not include them in `watches[]`.
3. **Priority** — high / normal / low. Default to normal if unspecified.
4. **Context** — ask the user to paste or describe what this quest is about. Turn it into a
   compact mission brief: objective, durable decision rules, important links, and the
   latest summary of things. Do not seed `context.md` with a conversation transcript or chronological
   updates; those belong in `timeline.ndjson`. If they already gave context earlier in the
   conversation, use that; don't re-ask.

### 2. Generate the quest ID

Format: `quest-<slug>-YYYY-MM-DD`

- Slug: lowercase title, non-alphanumerics replaced with `-`, collapsed, trimmed, max 40 chars. Example: "Correct EURC→USDC mechanism" → `correct-eurc-usdc-mechanism`.
- Date: today's UTC date, appended at the end.

Full example: `quest-correct-eurc-usdc-mechanism-2026-04-27`

### 3. Create the folder

**Always use `sq new-quest` — never write the files manually.**

The script handles all timestamps, ID generation, and correctly-shaped files. Manual `Write` calls have caused bugs (wrong `id` in meta.json, missing fields in watch.json). The script prevents all of that. Note: `watch_id` values are NOT in the scaffolded output — `ensure-watch-ids.py` injects them on the first triage tick. That is intentional and safe.

Build a JSON spec and pass it to the script via Bash:

```bash
sq new-quest '<spec_json>'
```

Spec fields:
- `title` (required) — display name
- `watches` (required) — entries WITHOUT `last_checked_ts`; the script injects it
- `priority` — `"high"` | `"normal"` | `"low"` (default: `"normal"`)
- `allow_send` — `true` | `false` (default: `false`)
- `sidequestor_bootstrap` is an internal dashboard-only flag. With `true`, `watches` must be
  empty and triage uses its dedicated bootstrap dispatch to resolve and install exact watches.
  Ordinary interactive creation must omit it and provide at least one confirmed watch.
- `context` — body text for `context.md`
- `note` — short note for the `created` timeline event (defaults to first 80 chars of context)
- `retire_slack_threads_after_days` — non-negative int or `false`:
  - omitted → the global default, `SIDEQUESTOR_RETIRE_DEFAULT_DAYS` (**14** days)
  - positive int N → drop `slack_thread` watches whose parent `thread_ts` is older than N days
  - `false` **or `0`** → never retire (use for long-lived partner conversations); `housekeep.py`
    treats both the same, along with any unparseable value
  - Examples: `7` for ephemeral chat (self-DM), `false` for partner monitoring

Example call:
```bash
sq new-quest '{
  "title": "Partner question — follow-up tracker",
  "priority": "normal",
  "allow_send": true,
  "context": "A partner asked a technical question; we replied and want to track the follow-up.",
  "watches": [
    {
      "type": "slack_thread",
      "channel_id": "C0123456789",
      "thread_ts": "1700000000.123456",
      "reason": "watching for partner follow-up on the technical question"
    },
    {
      "type": "schedule",
      "cron": "0 9 * * 1",
      "tz": "Asia/Singapore",
      "reason": "weekly Monday recap"
    }
  ]
}'
```

The script will:
1. Generate a unique quest ID from the title + today's UTC date
2. Set all `last_checked_ts` to the current epoch (so triage only looks forward)
3. Write all 4 files with the full canonical schema
4. Print a confirmation summary

Do NOT include `last_checked_ts` in the watches — the script will reject it.
Do NOT include reaction watch entries — reactions are tracked globally.

After the script runs, update `context.md` via `Edit` if you need to add more detail (Slack
permalinks, links, richer current-state narrative) that wasn't in the spec. Before editing it in
an interactive session, confirm no dispatch manifest is active for the quest; creation and the
background loop may overlap immediately after the folder appears.

### 4. Confirm to the user

The script prints its own confirmation. Relay it to the user and note any manual context.md updates you made.

## Extracting channel_id + thread_ts from a Slack permalink

A permalink looks like:
`https://<workspace>.slack.com/archives/<CHANNEL_ID>/p<TS_WITH_DOT_REMOVED>?thread_ts=<PARENT_TS>`

- **channel_id** = the segment after `/archives/`
- **thread_ts** = the `thread_ts` query param **if present**, otherwise the path `p...` segment converted back to `<10digits>.<6digits>` format

Example:
- `https://acme.slack.com/archives/C0123456789/p1700000000123456`
  → channel_id = `C0123456789`, thread_ts = `1700000000.123456`
- `https://acme.slack.com/archives/C0123456789/p1700000800000000?thread_ts=1700000000.123456`
  → channel_id = `C0123456789`, thread_ts = `1700000000.123456` (parent, not the reply)

Always watch the **parent thread_ts**, not a reply's ts.

## Validation checks before writing

**The script enforces these** — it exits non-zero rather than scaffolding something broken:

- Quest ID uniqueness across `state/quests/active/`, `archived/` **and `completed/`**. On a
  collision it appends `-2`, `-3`, … itself.
- `watches[]` has at least one entry, and every entry has a `type` and a `reason`.
- The `type` has an executable `checkers/<type>.py`, and carries that type's required fields.
- No `last_checked_ts` — the script sets it.
- Slack IDs are in the right namespace: `channel_id` is a conversation and `user_id` is a
  member (`U…`, or `W…` on Enterprise Grid). A conversation is `C…` (public channels,
  private channels **and group DMs** — a group DM really does come back as `C…`), `D…` (a
  one-to-one DM), or `G…` (legacy private channels and legacy group DMs, still in use).
  There is **no `MP` prefix**; that was this doc's own invention. A user ID pasted into a
  channel field is the mistake this catches: it sends fine and then watches a conversation
  that does not exist, silently, forever.

**This one is yours to check; the script does NOT** — shape is checkable, meaning is not:

- The IDs point at what the user actually meant. Resolve names via
  `mcp__slack__slack_search_users` and confirm before writing them in.

## Error handling

If the user's input is ambiguous or missing required fields, ask a clarifying question. Never create a quest with placeholder content — either get real values or don't create the quest.

## Resolving names to user IDs

If the user gives a name instead of a Slack user ID, look it up via:

```
mcp__slack__slack_search_users with query="<name>"
```

Present the result for confirmation before using it in watch.json. If multiple matches, list them and ask which one.
