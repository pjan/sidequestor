tick.py — the yaas idle-triage orchestrator (v3), a faithful port of the original shell orchestrator.

This is the coordinator that the original shell orchestrator was: it loops every active quest's watch.json, runs the
per-type checkers, decides per watch whether the watermark holds or advances, and — when there
is genuinely new activity — dispatches one paid worker per dirty target and commits only the
watermarks the worker's acks earned. Same gates (lock, bad-env, idle, budget, slack), same
evidence-based commit, same fairness rotation. (Stale replies are handled by slack-send.py's
always-on 24h draft guard, not by a whole-tick hold.)

What changed is HOW the decisions are made, not WHICH: the risky pure logic now lives in tested
modules (tick_state / tick_check / tick_dispatch, and the pre-existing ledger/dispatch helpers),
and this file is the sequencer that calls them and does the I/O they deliberately avoid — the
watch.json writes, the run-log events, the subprocess fan-out. The differential harness held
this file to the same goldens the original shell orchestrator produced (`run.sh check tick.py`),
so the port is behaviour-preserving by construction: same watch movements, same run-log event
sequence, same ack manifests, same exit code.

This is the live orchestrator — `triage-loop.sh` runs it. The port is complete and validated;
the original shell orchestrator has been retired to archive/.
