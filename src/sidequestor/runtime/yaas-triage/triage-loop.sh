# triage-loop.sh — long-running KeepAlive driver for tick.py (the orchestrator).
#
# Why this exists: on macOS 26.5.0 (post-update, 2026-06), launchd's
# StartInterval delivery for the package triage job stopped firing — the interval
# spawn shows "pended nondemand spawn = interval" but never delivers, even
# after a clean bootout/bootstrap. kickstart and RunAtLoad fire once but the
# recurring 60s timer is dead. Not power-related (AC, Low Power Mode off).
#
# The robust alternative is KeepAlive + an internal sleep loop: launchd keeps
# exactly one copy of THIS script alive (restarting it if it ever dies), and
# the loop itself paces tick.py at INTERVAL seconds. No dependency on the
# StartInterval timer.
#
# tick.py holds its own single-instance flock, so even if launchd briefly
# double-spawns this loop during a reload, the inner runs serialize safely.
