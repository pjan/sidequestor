    Returns `(count, preview, advance_to, complete, transient)`.

    Why this is not just "read the newest N"
    ────────────────────────────────────────
    Slack returns newest-first. If you read the newest N of a large backlog you hold a
    SUFFIX of the gap, and the unread part sits directly above the watermark — so the
    cursor can never move, and the next tick reads the same newest N and is stuck the
    same way. That is a livelock: it costs a dispatch every tick and never drains.

    The fix is to bound the read at BOTH ends. `oldest` alone already makes paging
    terminate at the watermark instead of walking a channel's whole history, which is
    the common case and costs one request. When the gap is bigger than one page we take
    a bounded forward SLICE — (watermark, watermark + slice] — which is a PREFIX of the
    gap. A prefix can be fully covered, so the cursor advances to the end of the slice
    and the backlog shrinks every tick until it is gone.
