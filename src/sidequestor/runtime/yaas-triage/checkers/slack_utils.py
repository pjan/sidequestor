    Read-backed checkers (slack_thread, slack_channel) get their boundary from drain(),

    slack_mention) cannot make that proof, so they need this instead — and before this
    existed they returned no advance_to at all, which is the dangerous case: tick.py's
    fallback then advances the watermark to `now - lag_map[type]`, and lag_map is built
    from optional `checkers/<type>.lag` files. `slack_mention.lag` happened to exist (90s);
    `slack_dm.lag` did not, so a slack_dm watch advanced to EXACTLY NOW on every clean
    search and any DM not yet indexed at that instant was buried permanently.

    Depending on a file existing on disk for a data-loss-prevention guarantee is the wrong
    shape, so the rule now lives here, in code, identically for both checkers.

    The rule: never claim more than `now - index_lag`, and never claim more than the newest
    message actually seen. Passing newest_seen <= 0 (nothing found) still returns

    Why this is not just "read the newest N"
    ────────────────────────────────────────
    Slack returns newest-first. If you read the newest N of a large backlog you hold a
    SUFFIX of the gap, and the unread part sits directly above the watermark — so the
    cursor can never move, and the next tick reads the same newest N and is stuck the
    same way. That is a livelock: it costs a dispatch every tick and never drains.

    The fix is to bound the read at BOTH ends. `oldest` alone already makes paging
    terminate at the watermark instead of walking a channel's whole history, which is
    the common case and costs one request. When the gap is bigger than one page we take
    a bounded forward SLICE — (watermark, watermark + slice] — which is a PREFIX of the
    gap. A prefix can be fully covered, so the cursor advances to the end of the slice
    and the backlog shrinks every tick until it is gone.
