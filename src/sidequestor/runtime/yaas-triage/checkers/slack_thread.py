checkers/slack_thread.py — check a Slack thread for new replies since watermark.

Input:  watch entry JSON as argv[1]
        {"type":"slack_thread","channel_id":"C...","thread_ts":"1234.567",
         "last_checked_ts":"1234.567","reason":"..."}

Output: one line of JSON per checkers/result.py. Pages the source (50/page, up to
        5 pages) until a message at or below the watermark proves the gap is
        covered; if it saturates first, emits complete=false so triage refuses to
        advance the cursor past messages it never saw. Reports advance_to as the
        newest message actually covered rather than letting triage guess "now".

Env:    MCP_CALL  path to mcp-call.sh (falls back to ../mcp-call.sh)
