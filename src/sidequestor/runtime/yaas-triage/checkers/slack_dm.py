checkers/slack_dm.py — check for new DMs from a watched Slack user since watermark.

Input:  watch entry JSON as argv[1]
        {"type":"slack_dm","channel_id":"D...","user_id":"U...",
         "last_checked_ts":"1234.567","reason":"..."}

Output: count|preview   (preview = snippet of newest new message)
        error|reason    (on MCP failure — triage treats this as dirty/retry)

Env:    MCP_CALL  path to mcp-call.sh (falls back to ../mcp-call.sh)
