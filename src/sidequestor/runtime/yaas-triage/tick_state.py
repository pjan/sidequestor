tick_state.py — the config and loading foundation of the tick.py orchestrator.

This is the first module of the real orchestrator rewrite: everything the tick reads before it
decides anything. It reproduces, faithfully, what the original shell orchestrator derives in its first ~90 lines plus
its "Per-checker watermark lag map" and "Gather quests" sections — repo root, paths, the numeric
env knobs (with the same refuse-on-garbage validation), the per-type watermark lag map, and the
list of active quests.

It is deliberately small and side-effect-light: it reads files and the environment, and it does
NOT write state, dispatch, or log to the run log. tick.py owns those. Keeping loading pure makes
it unit-testable against a fixture tree, which the shell version never was.

Named tick_state.py, not state.py, because the repo already has a top-level state/ directory and
a second thing called "state" invites confusion; the tick_ prefix marks the orchestrator's own
modules.

# Slack has two id namespaces that look alike and are NOT interchangeable: a conversation
# is C…, D… or G…, while a member is U… (or W… on Enterprise Grid).
#
# Which conversation gets which prefix is NOT the tidy split the old docs describe, so this
# is what a live Enterprise Grid workspace actually returns (sampled 2026-09-07):
#   C… public channels, private channels AND group DMs (mpims). A group DM really is C…,
#        e.g. a 3-person DM comes back as C0B2CJEPV7U — `is_mpim` is what marks it, not
#        the prefix. Modern private channels are C… too (#ext-circle-tazapay = C08FB4CR9M2).
#   G… legacy private channels and legacy mpims, still live and still watchable today
#        (#se-team = G01EC0UKCSZ), which is why G stays accepted rather than being dropped.
#   D… one-to-one DMs.
# There is no `MP` prefix in any of it; that claim came from this repo's own docs and was
# never a Slack thing.
#
# This matters because slack_send_message accepts EITHER as a destination and silently
# resolves a member id to that person's DM. So a member id pasted into channel_id sends
# perfectly, and only the watch built from it is broken: the checker polls a conversation
# that does not exist, forever, without ever erroring.
#
# Scope is deliberately NAMESPACE ONLY: the documented prefix, then one or more uppercase
# alphanumerics. It does not encode a length floor or a "contains a digit" rule, because
# Slack has never promised either — its 2016 id-format changelog explicitly tells clients
# not to assume the characters of an id — and this check REJECTS writes, so an invented
# invariant would refuse a legitimate watch. Compare dashboard-server.py's _ID_RE, which
# does demand 7+ chars and a digit: that one hunts ids inside free prose and only decides
# whether to linkify, so a false negative there costs a hyperlink, not a broken watch.
